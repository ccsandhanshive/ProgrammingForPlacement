These campus placements are arranged for by your college who invite all the best possible companies to recruit from their students. The campus placements are held before the final examination. These placements not only benefit the students, but they also benefit the companies and colleges.</li><li>However, as a student, you need to prepare well for the campus placements. Getting the best companies for the placement drive is the main job of your college. From there onward, you are the one responsible for what happens next. Of course, your college will prepare you, but there is still a whole lot more you can do. In the following blog, you will find all the information you need about campus placements and campus recruitments. This information will be your guide.</ul>"

The college invites the best companies and companies that have official partnerships with to come and interview students to gauge their potential as future employees. Companies may use their own form of the interview process. Post the interviews, they make selections, and sometimes even offer jobs and salary figures.<li>Off-Campus Placement</li>This is where you, as an individual, will seek employment on your own. It is completely up to you to get yourself placed in a company after you have finished your education. You have to take a lot of effort but you are a lot more in control of your employment. Many students resort to this type of placement after theyve failed to get an on-campus placement. Sometimes, students may get help from their college placement cell, but this help comes in the form of only providing contacts.</ul>"

      "information": "<p>One of the best ways you can prepare for a campus placement is by knowing about the complete procedure. This way, you can prepare for all the steps involved and feel more confident on the day of campus placement or recruitment interviews.</p><p>Here is the most common procedure for campus placement.</p><ol><li>Pre-Placement Presentation</li>This is the first part of the procedure. In the pre-placement presentation, the companies that have come for the campus placements put up presentations regarding their organisation. You get to know all about the companies, their recruitment process and the salaries you can expect. After the presentations, students are allowed to ask questions to the representatives.<li>Qualifications</li>In this step, you will know about the qualifications and other important criteria companies have set for recruitment. Usually, companies interview only those candidates that belong to a certain stream of education and will choose from among them. Since colleges teach multiple disciplines, and placements drives for all disciplines are held together, make sure you know which companies are interested in your education.<li>Written Examination</li>Once you know the companies you are going to be applying for, you will have to attempt an aptitude test. The test may vary based on the positions you are applying for, but there are a few tests specific to education streams. For example, during engineering placement drives, the Wheebox Graduate Employability Test is the standard test that most companies use. This exam tests coding skills, math skills, English language skills, and critical thinking skills. Similarly, there are other tests for other disciplines.<li>Group Discussion</li>A few times, this round is not conducted, but many companies use this for filtering candidates. A group of students is created that is moderated by a judge. A common topic is given for the group to discuss. Once the discussions begin, students are judged on their knowledge, their communication skills, their confidence, their leadership skills, and their listening and retaining capabilities. In the GD round, the latest news and current affairs are discussed, so you need to brush up on your knowledge.<li>Technical Knowledge Interview</li>This is an interview that will check your knowledge related to the subject you are studying, and other important technical knowledge that will be related to your profession. This round is mostly conducted in a one-on-one setting, but if there are many students and interviews are short on time, they may conduct interviews as a group.<li>Formal Interview</li>This is the final part of the procedure – formal interview. In this round, you are judged for your confidence and abilities. You can even term this interview as your job interview. If you have done internships, or have worked on real industry projects, it will really help you do well during this interview. In this interview, you will most likely know if you have been selected.<li>Post Placement Discussion</li>If you have cleared the formal interview, you will get an offer letter and a post-placement discussion. You will be given guidelines and be told about the joining procedure. You will also be told any other important information you need to know.</ol>"

      "heading": "Tips for Campus Placement Preparation",
      "information": "<p>Now that you know about the stepwise procedure, it is time you know about how to prepare for campus placements.</p><p>Here a few tips you can use to prepare for placements and get the job you want in the company you want.</p><ul><li>Know your Stuff</li><p>This is what recruiters will be looking for. It is one thing to clear your exam with excellent marks, but it is another thing to be able to know your stuff at the drop of a hat. So, you have to know about your education, and you should be able to talk about it whenever asked about it.</p><p>It also helps to have a favourite subject. It becomes easier to learn and even recall. So, if you have a favourite subject, make sure you are an expert on it, because it is likely that you will be asked about it during placements.</p><li>Aptitude Tests</li><p>You will be taking an aptitude test set by the company. And since you know about it, you can prepare by taking online aptitude tests. There are many websites with tough aptitude tests that can really help you get the hang of aptitude tests and do well. Use your free time to do these freely available tests.</p><p>You can look for tests based on your educational discipline and start preparing. For example, if you are an engineering student, there are aptitude tests for engineers. If you are a management student, you can look for management aptitude tests. And these tests are quite easy to find online.</p><li>Write & Speak Well</li><p>Work on your English speaking and writing skills. In India, English is the official language businesses communicate. Therefore, to increase your chances of being selected as a candidate, work on your English writing and speaking skills. Recruiters will test both of these during your interview.</p><p>Always try to converse in English with your friends and family. Read a lot of books, magazines, and newspapers. This will also help you increase your vocabulary. Also, get into the practice of writing a journal. Many talented candidates even get rejected owing to poor communication skills, so take this seriously.</p><li>Brush up Technical Knowledge</li><p>If you are getting educated in a technical discipline, be sure to brush up on your technical knowledge and skills. In campus placements interviews, there is a lot of importance placed on technical skills, and you will be mostly grilled about your technical knowledge.</p><p>Keep reading and updating your technical knowledge. Practical work is the best way to do this. More than anything else, this is what recruiters are concerned with and if you can display your technical knowledge and skills, you are bound to get selected for a job.</p><li>Mock Interviews</li><p>One of the most nerve-wracking parts of the placement process is the one-on-one interviews. Campus placements are probably the first time you are facing an interview. Therefore, it is quite natural to be nervous. But there is a way you can deal with your nerves and do well in the interview – mock interviews.</p><p>Many colleges conduct mock interview exercises as a way to help their students prepare for placements. Make sure you are a part of them. You can also practice mock interviews with your friends as a means to prepare. This will truly help you.</p><li>Develop Marketable Skills</li><p>In the competitive professional world, just knowing about your subject is not enough, you need to have other forms of skills and knowledge that will project you as a well-rounded candidate that is worth employing.</p><p>Presentation skills, email writing skills, public speaking skills may be expected from an MBA student, but imagine an engineer having these skills. Similarly, if an MBA student knows programming languages and coding, it will instantly make them stand out from the rest. These are the skills you should acquire to give yourself a better chance.</p><li>Improve General Knowledge</li><p>General knowledge matters a lot. If you have good general knowledge, you will automatically do well in the interview and group discussions. Good general knowledge also portrays you as someone aware of your surroundings and also knows about what is happening in the industry.</p><p>To increase your general knowledge, you need to make use of the internet. Read up on all the latest national and international news, and news related to the industry you hope to work in. Also, read the newspaper. Get into the habit of it. It will increase your general knowledge and increase your chances of getting hired during campus placements.</p></ul>"

They also negotiate for salaries on your behalf. Theres also less competition as you will be competing with only students from your college. It is a controlled environment where students can feel comfortable and interact with the recruiters. You get a lot of support from your college, and your college reputation also plays a positive part. And since the interview procedures are set, you can prepare on your own<li>Off-Campus Placements</li>are a lot more difficult to crack. All the advantages stated in On-Campus Placements The only advantage you have here is that you have a wider variety of companies to choose from. Students have to be reliant on this form of placement only if they fail to get placed during On Campus Placement.
